# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?

I used the terminal-table gem to present the lists in tables.

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Feature 1... lists appear in tables
  b) Feature 2... a count of the items in each list appears next to the list title.

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?

  About two or three days.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

  Getting the gem to work was tricky. It wasn't always obvious to me what the explanations in the readme meant. I ended copying one of the examples into my own code and then gradually adjusting it until I could get it to do what I wanted.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?

  The first feature was to present the lists as tables. This just makes them easier to read.

  The second was to add a list item count next to the list title. This should be helpful if lists become a lot longer.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?

  Knowing when something is a class or instance variable and how to access it, continues to be a challenge. Also, I still find loops to iterate through arrays tricky.
